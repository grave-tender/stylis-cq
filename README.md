# stylis-cq

!!! 0.1.x versions won't work, still figuring out why, will update to 1.0.0 once it's fully functionning. Actively working on it.

This is a copy of [stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis) version 3.5.4 used by a dependency of the also modified [styled-jsx-container](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-jsx-container) modified to support container queries. This is to be the other package's custom dependency.

PS: I'll deprecate this soon as stylis gets support for container queries natively.

Big thanks to [Ange](https://github.com/angeblecon) as he's the one who first figured out how to add the container query.
