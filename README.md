# stylis-cq

This is a copy of [stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis) version 3.5.4 used by as a dependency of the also modified [styled-jsx-container](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-jsx-container). The goal is to replace its stylis dependency with this version. We added the same instructions the media queries have under the name of containers, thus they should behave the same.

The latest version of stylis does support container queries but not stylis@3.5.4 which is what styled-jsx uses. This package might not be needed in future styled-jsx versions.

Big thanks to [Ange](https://github.com/angeblecon) as he's the one who first figured out how to add the container query.
